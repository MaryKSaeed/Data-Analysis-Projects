# Movies Gross Correlations

## Project Overview
The **Movies Gross Correlations** project aimed to analyze the factors influencing the gross revenue of movies. Using a dataset of **5421 movies**, the analysis explored relationships between key features such as budget, votes, and company name to understand their impact on a movie's financial success.

## Key Objectives
- **Dataset Analysis**: Identify factors that significantly correlate with gross revenue.
- **Data Transformation**: Clean and preprocess the dataset to ensure accuracy and consistency.
- **Visualization**: Use data visualization to uncover patterns and trends in the data.

## Tools and Techniques
- **Python Libraries**: Pandas, Numpy for data cleaning and transformation.
- **Visualization Tools**: Seaborn, Matplotlib to create insightful visualizations.

## Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Removed missing or inconsistent entries.
   - Transformed and standardized numerical features.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Conducted correlation analysis to identify relationships between variables.
   - Created visualizations to better understand data patterns.
3. **Key Correlation Findings**:
   - **Budget vs. Gross Revenue**: High positive correlation (**0.712**).
   - **Votes vs. Gross Revenue**: Moderate correlation (**0.61**).
   - **Company Name vs. Gross Revenue**: Minimal impact (**0.15**).

## Results
### Insights
1. **Budget as a Driver**:
   - Higher budgets significantly drive gross revenue.
2. **Impact of Votes**:
   - A considerable number of votes moderately correlates with gross revenue.
3. **Company Influence**:
   - A movie's production company has minimal impact on gross revenue.

### Visualizations
The following visualizations were used to highlight trends:
- Heatmap to illustrate correlations between variables.
- Scatter plots to display the relationship between budget and gross revenue.

## Conclusion
The analysis revealed that **budget** is the most significant factor influencing gross revenue, followed by **votes**, while **company name** has minimal impact. These insights can help movie producers and stakeholders allocate resources effectively to maximize profitability.
