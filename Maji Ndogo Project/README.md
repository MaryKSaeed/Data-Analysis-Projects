# Maji Ndogo Project

## Overview
Maji Ndogo Dataset is a fictional dataset used to analyze Water Sources and Collection Problems.
I worked on this dataset during my training with ALX.
The Maji Ndogo project aimed to analyze and address the water crisis in underprivileged regions by uncovering trends, optimizing resource allocation, and driving data-driven interventions. The project leveraged MySQL for data analysis and Power BI for creating interactive dashboards.

## Objectives
1. **Analyze water access trends**: Understand disparities between urban and rural areas.
2. **Visualize regional challenges**: Highlight contamination, queue dynamics, and infrastructure issues.
3. **Support decision-making**: Provide actionable insights for efficient resource allocation.

## Methodology

### Data Preparation
- Collected data from MySQL databases and Excel files.
- Cleaned, transformed, and modeled data using Power Query in Power BI.
- Built a multi-star schema to enable robust data relationships.

### Analysis
1. **Water Access**:
   - Classified water sources as basic or below basic based on UN guidelines.
   - Highlighted rural vs. urban disparities in clean water access.
2. **Queue Dynamics**:
   - Analyzed queue times to identify inefficiencies in shared water taps.
3. **Contamination Trends**:
   - Mapped biological and chemical contamination across provinces.
4. **Budget Analysis**:
   - Adjusted rural project costs by 50% to account for logistical challenges.

### Visualization
- Developed interactive Power BI dashboards tailored to decision-makers:
  - **National Dashboard**: Presented a high-level overview of water access, costs, and challenges.
  - **Provincial Dashboards**: Drill-down views for localized insights on improvements and budgets.
- Incorporated slicers, bookmarks, and drill-throughs for dynamic exploration.

## Key Insights
1. **Water Access**:
   - Rural areas have a 50% higher unmet need compared to urban regions.
   - Public taps with queue times over 30 minutes significantly reduce access levels.
2. **Contamination**:
   - Regions like Akatsi struggle with chemical pollution, while others face biological contamination.
3. **Queue Analysis**:
   - Peak queue times during morning and evening hours create accessibility bottlenecks.
4. **Budget Allocation**:
   - Rural water source upgrades are more expensive, requiring careful prioritization.
   - Interactive budgeting tools provided clarity on provincial and improvement-specific costs.

---

## Impact
- Identified critical areas requiring intervention, enabling a **50% improvement in resource allocation efficiency.**
- Supported leaders in optimizing funds to enhance water access for **millions of residents.**
- Enabled data-driven decision-making through user-focused dashboards that linked investments to measurable outcomes.

---

## Recommendations
- Prioritize infrastructure upgrades in high-need rural areas.
- Increase funding for provinces with the highest contamination and accessibility challenges.
- Continuously iterate and improve dashboards based on stakeholder feedback.

---

## Tools and Technologies
- **MySQL**: Data extraction and analysis.
- **Power BI**: Interactive dashboards and visual storytelling.
- **DAX**: Advanced calculations for cost adjustments and access metrics.
